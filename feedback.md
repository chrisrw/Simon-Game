# Feedback

Congrats on satisfying the project requirements! Here's some feedback for you:

## Code Quality

Is the code well formatted? Are variable and function names semantic and sensible? Is the code easy to read and understand?

- Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues.
- In general, I'd not recommend using tag selectors (e.g., h1) to target elements for styling because they are not specific enough and can easily get overridden. Just stick with class selectors instead.
- Take a look at the way I've refactored some of your code. Also, make sure to remove any unused code from your HTML/JS/CSS files!

## Technical Requirements

How does the project stack up to the requirements for this project? Is the developer making use of the material we've covered in a way that makes sense?

- Your game looks really good in the browser! Great job using CSS grid to layout your game components. See inline comment on using `px` rather `em` or `rem`.

## Creativity and Interface

Is the application easy to navigate? Does it work well in every major browser? Is it responsive? Does it incorporate modern UI Themes?

- Your app looks really cool and different! I thought the overall design was really neat.

## Functionality

Does the application work without errors or bugs? Does it present a complete app, where every feature is fully implemented in a way that makes sense?

- Your game has a functional and creative interface, and it works. I loved the way you integrated sounds into your game!

## Presentation

Is there adequate documentation? Is the repository well organized and free of clutter?

- Your readme contains relevant information about the application. However, please format your readme with proper markdown syntax and relevant sections. See these examples: https://github.com/esin87/travelogue or https://github.com/esin87/StarTrek_TNG_Trivia_Game

## Additional Feedback

- Take a look at some of my inline comments on your code.
