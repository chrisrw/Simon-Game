# Simon-Game

Objective: Simon will create a sequence of lights and the user is required to repeat the sequence. Each round that the user can accurately repeat simon's sequence, simon will add onto its sequence by one. Each time the user can accurately mimic simon's sequence, the user will add one point to the users score.

Instructions for users: To start the game, you will click on the "Start" button below the squares. Doing this will start the game. Let simon's sequence play out and try to remember it in its exact order. After simon's sequence is done and the boxes have stopped lighting up, you must click the squares in the order that Simon had previously lit up. If you click the squares in an incorrect order, a "Game Over" message will be displayed at the top of the screen, and the game will be over.
